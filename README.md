# dataModel.ParksAndGardens
These data models are intended to model parks, gardens and related green spaces in a city.

The following entity types are available:
- [FlowerBed](https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.ParksAndGardens/FlowerBed/README.md
). A FlowerBed is a distinguishable planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for
the display, cultivation, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature.


- [Garden](https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.ParksAndGardens/Garden/README.md
). A garden is a distinguishable planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for
the display, cultivation, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature.


- [GreenspaceRecord](https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.ParksAndGardens/GreenspaceRecord/README.md
). This entity contains a harmonised description of the conditions recorded on
a particular area or point inside a greenspace (flower bed, garden, etc.).
This entity type has been inspired by the AgriParcelRecord entity type
defined by the GSMA Harmonized Data Models.
