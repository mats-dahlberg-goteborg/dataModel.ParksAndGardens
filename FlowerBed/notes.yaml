  ### Representing measurements related to a flower bed

  There are two options for representing measurements observed:

    - A/ Through a linked entity of type `GreenspaceRecord` (attribute named
      `refRecord`).
    - B/ Through a group of measurement properties already defined by
      [GreenspaceRecord](../../GreenspaceRecord/doc/spec.md).

  Below is the description of the attribute to be used for option A/.

  - `refRecord`: List of records which contain measurements related to this
                   flower bed.
                   -   Attribute type: Relationship. List of references to entities of type
                   `GreenspaceRecord`
                   - Optional
